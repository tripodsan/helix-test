# This document only contains paragraphs

The SmartLineFeeds feature of gdocs2md allows  
Authors to just hit `<ENTER>` to create  
  
new  
  
Lines. Also it allows them to add more  
  
  
  
  
  
Space  
  
  
  
Between lines.  


## Special Cases

When there is a code block paragraph

```
{
  A:1,
  B:2,
}
```

It should probably create paragraphs.  
Also, when there is a list:  


-   Bananas
-   Apples
-   Kiwi

It should probably create paragraphs.
