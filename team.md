### Project Helix – Product Vision

> For companies and individuals who want to have a digital presence and conduct business online, this new experience management service provides a cost-effective way to create, manage, and deliver great digital experiences.
> Unlike existing offerings, it takes an intuitive and simple approach to experience management and scales it up to enterprise needs.

### Who will use Project Helix

Project Helix will be used by individuals and companies, large and small. With increasing size of the company, user roles and responsibilities get increasingly differentiated. Hence it makes sense to group users groups by organization.

### Top 6 from our Project Manifesto

#### Open Meritocracy
We will work as meritocracy, input from others, and reviewing PRs and contributing to other projects is a top priority.

#### Open Source
If we don't have a good reason why something should be private, it should be public. All new repos, live on public github.

#### Diversity
We are a diverse team in every respect.

#### No Meetings
Get-togethers and hackathons only.

#### More code, less blah, blah
Code wins. Everybody codes. Commits.

#### Beautiful Creations
Well designed, beautiful output.
